# PharmaRecall

### PLATFORM MARKING THE TRACEABILITY OF PRODUCTS
IN CASE OF PRODUCT RECALL

The main objective of this project is to solve a complex and common supply chain management problem
problem of supply chain management, namely the recall of products (Case of the products ( Medicines in Moroccan Pharmacies).
supply chain, namely product recall. The reasons that lead to the recall of a product can be the following: the product is
infected, defective, not up to standard or malfunctioning. This leads us to go back up the supply chain and identify the cause of the
supply chain and identify the root cause of the order recall. orders. Often, this is accomplished by a complicated query
involving multi-table joins. And when dealing with large data sets, it is best to find an efficient solution to such problems.
to solve such problems. This project includes two different types of different types of implementations that involve the creation and manipulation of
graph data. The first implementation is a standalone application application via the Neo4j serverThe server is accessed by a web browser and provides

existing systems usually involve searching for data in various source tables and in various source tables and joining them to form a solution.
